# Laravel + Blade Starter Kit

---

## Introduction

Our Laravel 12 + Blade starter kit provides the typical functionality found in the Laravel Starter kits, but with a few key differences:

- A CoreUI/AdminLTE inspired design layout
- Blade + AlpineJS code

This kit aims to fill the gap where there is no simple **Blade only** starter kit available.

Our internal goal at Laravel Daily is to start using this starter kit for our Demo applications, to avoid overwhelming our audience with Vue/Livewire/React if we had used one of the official Laravel 12 starter kits.

**Note:** This is Work in Progress kit, so it will get updates and fixes/features as we go.
